Synthetic Data Generation for Deep Computer Vision

## Project Abstract

Collecting measured datasets for machine learning problems is infeasible for many domains of research. Using synthetic data presents an opportunity to bring machine learning to these domains economically. This research intends to study the degree of similarity necessary between synthetic data and measured data to achieve a particular level of performance, a henceforth largely unstudied problem.
