# Major Constraints

## Economic Costs

This project has requirements on having access to sufficient compute facilities. Training neural networks and generating synthetic datasets isn't computationally cheap, especially for large datasets. My personal computer has a fairly powerful GPU, but it will take wise time management or access to faster hardware to ensure successful completion of training in a reasonable amount time.

Additionally, I'd prefer to use publically-available datasets as the reference sets and I'd prefer to stick to non-proprietary software libraries for doing the training and experimentation. These are less significant restraints, however, since the field of machine learning is pretty open.

## Scope

The scope of the project is still vague, largely in part to unknowns in how long certain chunks of the project will take to complete. The original modality of interest was SAR imagery, and I had some initial ideas in mind on how to generate synthetic imagery and compare training and testing distributions. If completing the research of interest for SAR imagery doesn't take the entire two semesters, however, it would be natural to expand the scope to include other modalities in computer vision or to consider datasets in completely other domains, such as natural language processing or structured datasets.

## Professional and Technical Expertise

I have some experience with machine learning pipelines, but it would a stretch to say I currently possess all the necessary expertise to complete this project. Much of the project's timeline consists of researching necessary techniques, not to mention to improving my ability to synthesize results of research papers. I need to be careful that I'm not overly reliant on the expertise of my mentor, as well. While he will available for guidance, I need to make sure I am the one making the insights and performing the research, not him.
