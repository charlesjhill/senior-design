# User Interface Specification

As a research oriented project, the goal was not to develop a software product to be used by other parties, but rather, to discover a particular relationship between data similarity and future machine learning model performance, and develop a process that could be used for further research. As such, there is no graphical user interface, nor terminal tool developed specifically for public consumption.

Research was performed, instead, via interaction with proprietary web-based tools (such as the one developed in-house at to generate distributions of operating characteristics), proprietary experiment management tools (e.g., Etegent Technologies' ATLAS), or other miscellaneous Python and terminal scripts.
