## Timeline

### Research Tasks (11 Oct 2021 - 31 Dec 2021)
  - Compile list of publically-available datasets for each modality to use as a reference
  - Compile list of suitable data augmentations for each modality
  - Determine what range of data augmentations are appropriate for experimentation
  - Research methods for constructing synthetic data for each modality
  - Research methods of computing dataset similarity, suitable for each modality
  - Research reference models to use for each modality/domain

## Milestone 3 | Complete Computational Trials

### Analysis Tasks (1 Mar 2022 - 5 Apr 2022)
  - Analyze results of research trials to determine importance of different features or synthetic data generator parameters
  - Analyze results for overarching performance trends based on dataset similarity
  - Compile results into report and presentation

## Milestone 4 | Complete Project Deliverables

## Notes
There is overlap in the timelines of running research trials and finishing algorithmic groundwork. This is possible since "running research trials" is a largely hands-off task that can begin without all the different code modules being complete. Some modules do need to be completed before running trials, of course, but it would be needless to require them all be completed before running any trials.

Additionally, I have scheduled some overlap between running research trials and doing analysis/compilation for final report + presentation. Given that findings can be broken doing by modality, when trials are being executed for one modality, I can compile results for another modality.
