## Project Title
Impact of Train/Test Dataset Similarity on Model Performance

## Goal Statement
Often, collecting measured datasets for machine learning problems is logistically infeasible for many modalities and domains of research. Using synthetic data presents an opportunity to bring machine learning to these domains. The degree to which synthetic data needs to be similar to measured data to achieve a particular level of performance has been henceforth unstudied, however. I intend to fill this gap by examining this important, but under-studied area.

## Design Diagram Legend

- Parallelograms represent input from a user
- Rectangles represent processing performed by the system
- Circles represent output from the system to a user
- Lines between nodes represent sequential processing steps
- The "containers" with text information correspond to the similarly-titled node in the flowchart, and provide additional detail on what options are expected to be available, or serve to clarify what statistical techniques or specific processes are involved with that step
