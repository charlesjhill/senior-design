## Co-op Work Experience

### Junior Engineer @ Etegent Technologies | 2018 - Present

#### Web Development
- Primary (~33% Lines of Code) contributor on the translation of a geospatial and temporal data analysis tool from MATLAB to a ASP.NET/Angular web-application
  - Designed the API surface for this data analysis application
  - Co-designed the UI and UX workflow for this data analysis application
- Created a dashboard using Svelte and Django for monitoring streaming image data from a Apache Kafka producer
  - Used Socket.IO to stream annotated video stills to a web frontend
  - Designed and implemented system to allow users to "scrub" through these annotated video stills
  - Designed and implemented mechanism for alerting users of "objects of interest" appearing in any video feed
- Re-wrote a Django web application for management of experiment parameters using Vue3

#### Algorithms and Optimization
- Led R&D effort to optimize internal computational geometry routines, increasing performance by ~17x
- Re-wrote routine for persisting experiment parameters and generated samples to a Sqlite database, increasing performance by 1-2 orders of magnitude

#### Machine Learning
- Created and fine-tuned a ResNet model which matched SOTA performance in SAR imagery classification
- Contributed multiple modules to internal ML experiment framework


## Project Sought
In Machine Learning problems, having a training set which allows a model to generalize to real-world data in a given domain
is critical to building an accurate, useful model. However, acquiring such training sets is often expensive
or outright impossible. Approximating real-world data with synthetic, generated data is feasible, however.

The project I'm seeking is to study the relationship between the performance of a model and the similarity of its
training and testing datasets, with the objective being to determine what level of similarity is required for the model to reach
a particular level of performance on a given task.
