## Effort Breakdown

### Research Tasks [2 months effort]
  - Compile list of publically-available datasets for each modality to use as a reference
  - Compile list of suitable data augmentations for each modality
  - Determine what range of data augmentations are appropriate for experimentation
  - Research methods for constructing synthetic data for each modality
  - Research methods of computing dataset similarity, suitable for each modality
  - Research reference models to use for each modality/domain  

### Initial Testbed and Infastructure Development [1 week effort]
  - Acquire compute resources necessary for conducting experiments
  - Develop testbed for conducting experiments

### Algorithmic Groundwork (1 Jan 2022 - 7 Mar 2022) [2 months effort]
  - Implement or acquire existing implementations of data augmentations
  - Implement or acquire existing implementations of synthetic data generators
  - Implement methods for computing dataset similarity, or acquire existing implementations
  - Implement or acquire implementations of selected reference models
### Run research trials (1 Feb 2022 - 15 Mar 2022) [Neglible man-hours needed]

### Analysis Tasks (1 Mar 2022 - 5 Apr 2022) [3-5 weeks effort]
  - Analyze results of research trials to determine importance of different features or synthetic data generator parameters
  - Analyze results for overarching performance trends based on dataset similarity
  - Compile results into report and presentation
