## Necessary Project Tasks

- Research Tasks
  - Compile list of publically-available datasets for each modality to use as a reference
  - Compile list of suitable data augmentations for each modality
  - Determine what range of data augmentations are appropriate for experimentation
  - Research methods for constructing synthetic data for each modality
  - Research methods of computing dataset similarity, suitable for each modality
  - Research reference models to use for each modality/domain  
- Development Tasks  
  - Implement or acquire existing implementations of data augmentations
  - Implement or acquire existing implementations of synthetic data generators
  - Implement methods for computing dataset similarity, or acquire existing implementations
  - Implement or acquire implementations of selected reference models
  - Develop testbed for conducting experiments
- Infrastructure Tasks
  - Acquire compute resources necessary for conducting experiments
  - Run research trials
- Analysis Tasks
  - Analyze results of research trials to determine importance of different features or synthetic data generator parameters
  - Analyze results for overarching performance trends based on dataset similarity
  - Compile results into report and presentation
