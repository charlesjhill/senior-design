## Necessary Project Tasks

- Compile list of publically-available datasets for each modality to use as a refereence
- Compile list of suitable data augmentations for each modality
- Implement or acquire existing implementations of data augmentations
- Determine what range of data augmentations are appropriate for experimentation
- Research methods for constructing synthetic data for each modality
- Implement or acquire existing implementations of synthetic data generators
- Research methods of computing dataset similarity, suitable for each modality
- Implement methods for computing dataset similarity, or acquire existing implementations
- Research reference models to use for each modality/domain
- Implement or acquire implementations of selected reference models
- Develop testbed for conducting experiments
- Acquire compute resources necessary for conducting experiments
- Run research trials
- Analyze results of research trials to determine importance of different features or synthetic data generator parameters
- Analyze results for overarching performance trends based on dataset similarity
- Compile results into report and presentation
