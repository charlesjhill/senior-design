## Milestones

- **31 December 2021** | Complete Background Research
  - A lot of background study on various parts of the project needs to be complete to get the ball rolling on computational trials. For instance, what data augmentations are suitable, publically-available datasets, dataset similarity algorithms, all need to be determined to effectively run the trials

- **1 February 2022** | Begin Computational Trials, Complete Testbed Development
  - Beginning computational trials in earnest Feb. 1 allows for a month to get the test environment and any other infrastructure squared away and a further month and a half to run the trials themselves.
  - Due to the nature of the trials, I will be able to get development work out of the way concurrently with trials being computed.

- **15 March 2022** | Complete Computational Trials
  - The bulk of the project is doing computational study, so if all the computation is done by March 15, that will give three weeks to pull together the computational results into a poster and report

- **5 April 2022** | Project Completion
  - This is one week prior to the Tech Expo, so it seems reasonable to have everything complete at this point to have a buffer period to make any last-minute adjustments
