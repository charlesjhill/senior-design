# Hours Summary

What follows is a summary of hours for Charles Hill only, as I was the only student on the project. Not included in these projections were "idle" time were computational resources were being used but no active work was being completed. 

## Fall Semester Hours

Charles Hill | 35 Hours

This comprises:

- Meetings with my project advisor and colleagues at Etegent Technologies to discuss project parameters, goals, and action items 
- Performing background research to familiarize myself with standard dataset comparison techniques
- Reading research papers on prior work in Synthetic Aperture Radar Automatic Target Recognition (SAR-ATR) systems and methodology for computer vision models that would be applicable to this domain
- Filling in my body of knowledge on other information relevant to SAR imagery collection and processing, and
- Completing the entirety of course assignments, such as the creation and recording of presentations and creating of planning documents (timelines, tasklists, etc.)

## Spring Semester Hours

Charles Hill | 60 Hours

- This comprises 30 hours of activites billed to Etegent Technolgies beginning in January 2022. As part of their sponsorship of this project, I was able to bill for hours that contributed to their business needs. This includes work on the synthetic data generation pipeline's operating characteristic generator, performing research and development on a statistical technique to allow for the analysis of dataset similarity appropriate for the domain of SAR imagery, and any other time connected to Etegent systems to access proprietary data or meeting with colleagues.
- The remaining 30 hours of Spring Semester time was accumulated working on all the other facets of the Senior Design project which were not relevant to their business needs. As the only student on this project, I was responsible for completing the entirety of every course assignment. In the Spring semester, the biggest items were creating the design and layout, as well as assembling or writing the content, of the final PowerPoint presentation and Project Poster, and attending the relevant expos.
