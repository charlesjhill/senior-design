# Expense Summary

There were no expenses incurred as a result of working on the project.

## Donated Resources

The primary reason there were no expenses incurred during the project was that all of its required computation resources - such as GPU compute time, storage, and so on - were provided at no cost to me by my project's sponsor, Etegent Techonologies.

All software used during the project was either freely available to public or was Etegent Technologies' proprietary software and was available for me to use at no direct expense.
